## Instructions

Oven to 425F

Heat skillet - med

Scrub sweet potato, slice to 1/4‚Äù rings

Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towel.  In a small bowl, combine the salt, garlic powder, and pepper, then sprinkle over the meat on both sides.

In a cast-iron skillet, heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat until hot.  Place chicken thighs into the pan, skin side down and cover with a splatterguard.  Cook without moving for 7-9 minutes so that the fat can render and the skin can get nice and crispy.

Once the chicken releases from the pan and has a nicely browned crust on the skin, flip the chicken pieces over using tongs.  Transfer the skillet with the chicken to the oven and roast for 18 minutes until cooked through and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165 degrees F when tested with an instant read meat thermometer.
