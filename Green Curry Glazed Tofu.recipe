# Green Curry Glazed Tofu

1  (14- to 16-ounce) block extra-firm tofu

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

1  (14-ounce) can full-fat, unsweetened coconut milk

3 to 4  tablespoons Thai green curry paste

1  tablespoon neutral or coconut oil, plus more as needed

2  cups chopped vegetables, such as snap or snow peas, asparagus, broccoli, kale, fennel or corn kernels or a combination (see Tip)

2  tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)

Cooked rice or another grain, for serving

Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise into 6 sections. (Youâ€™ll have 12 squares total.) Transfer to a towel-lined plate and pat dry, then sprinkle with salt

Transfer the coconut milk to a liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, add the green curry paste, stir with a fork until smooth, then season to taste with salt. (Be aware that some curry pastes are quite salty

Arrange the tofu in an even layer in a large (12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Pour 2 tablespoons coconut-curry mixture over the tofu and flip the tofu to coat. Set the skillet over medium-high and cook tofu without flipping until the skillet is dry and the undersides of the tofu are speckled golden, 3 to 5 minutes

Add the oil, swirl to coat, then flip the tofu. Cook until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes, then flip once more until the remaining side is browned and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes, adding additional oil as needed. Transfer to a plate

If the skillet is dry, add more oil, over medium-high, then add the vegetables, season with salt, and cook, without stirring, until charred underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the remaining coconut-curry mixture and boil, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-tender and the liquid has thickened to a glaze, 4 to 5 minutes. (The sauce is ready when a spoon dragged across the bottom of the skillet leaves a trail.) Turn off the heat, stir in the lime juice, then add the tofu and gently stir to coat. Season to taste with salt. Eat on top of rice
