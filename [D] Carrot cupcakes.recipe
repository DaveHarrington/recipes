# [D] Carrot cupcakes

## CUPCAKES

1 1/4 cup (160 grams) all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, optional

1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, optional

1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, optional

1/2 cup (118 ml) canola or other vegetable oil

1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar

1/2 cup (100 grams) lightly packed brown sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 large eggs

1 1/2 cups (150 grams) grated peeled carrots (2 to 3 medium carrots)

1/4 cup (50 grams) coarsely chopped pecans, optional

1/4 cup (32 grams) raisins, optional

## MAKE BATTER

Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners

In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and the nutmeg until well blended

In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, until combined

Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins

## BAKE CUPCAKES

Divide the batter between the prepared muffin cups, filling about 3/4 of the way to the top. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes

Cool cupcakes in the pan for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely before frosting

MAKE FROSTING

In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and salt with a handheld mixer on medium speed until very creamy, about 2 minutes

For the creamiest frosting, sift the powdered sugar or whisk until most large lumps are gone

Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time until fluffy. For a thicker frosting, add an additional 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of powdered sugar

To make spiced frosting, beat in a pinch of ground cinnamon or cardamom

## TO FINISH

Frost cooled cupcakes and if youâ€™d like top with coarsely chopped pecans

Store frosted cupcakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days
