- Bananas | 3 | ripe
- Medjool dates | 5 | 
- Egg | 1 | 
- Oat milk | 75 ml | 
- Oatmeal | 100g | 
- wholemeal spelt flour | 100g | 
- teaspoon cinnamom | 1.5 tsp | 
- speculaas | 1 tsp | 
- baking soda | 1 tsp | 
- apple cider vinegar | 2 tablespoon | 
- salt | 1 pinch | 
- carrot | 1.5 | grated
- mixed nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts or pecan) | 3 handfuls | 
- pecans | 1 handful | 

Preheat the oven to 350 F

Mix the bananas, the 3 Medjool dates (pitted), the egg and the oat milk in the blender until smooth. Pour into a large bowl.

Put the apple cider vinegar and baking soda in a bowl and stir it lightly.

Add it together with the flour, cinnamon, gingerbread spices and salt to this mix.

Mix this well by using a whisk or a spatula.

Grate the carrot and cut the other two Medjool dates into pieces.

Add the carrot, pieces of dates and three handfuls of mixed nuts (preferably broken in half) to the batter.

Cover the baking pan with parchment paper and then pour the batter into the baking pan. Make sure the batter is evenly distributed in the pan.

Decorate the loaf with some pecans and slide it in the oven for about 45 minutes.

If the top turns brown a little too quickly, it is advisable to cover the loaf with the edge of the baking paper so that the cake does not burn.

Let it cool well on wire rack before cutting the carrot banana loaf.
