- Curly kale |  | rinsed, shredded, tough stalks removed
- Crusty bread |  | to serve
- Soft Cooking Chorizo | 2 1/2 oz | 1/2 inch slices
- Chickpeas | 1 can | 
- Chopped tomatoes | 1 can |

- Onion | 1 | finely sliced

Heat the oil in a large non-stick saucepan over a medium heat.

Add the onion and garlic and fry gently for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned.

Drain the chickpeas in a sieve and rinse under cold water.

Stir the chorizo slices and hot smoked paprika into the onion and garlic mixture and fry for a further 2 minutes.

Add the tinned tomatoes, water and tomato purée to the pan and stir well. Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering.

Add them to the tomato mixture and return it to a simmer. Continue to simmer for 10 minutes [simmer], stirring once or twice, until the volume of sauce has reduced by about half.

Add the kale to the stew and continue to simmer for a further 2 minutes until tender.

Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
