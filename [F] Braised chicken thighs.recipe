# [F] Braised chicken thighs

- bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs | 6 | 
- Onion | 1 large | sliced thin
- Fennel bulb | 1 | cored and sliced thin
- Garlic cloves | 4 | smashed
- Orange peel | 6 | 2 inch strips
- Rosemary | 2 sprigs | 
- Bay leaf | 1 | 
- Dry white wine | 1/4 cup | 
- French green olives (e.g. Picholine) | 1 cup | 

Preheat oven to 350 F

Heat olive oil in an enameled cast iron braiser over medium heat.

Season the chicken all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper

Add the chicken thighs skin side down and sear until well-browned, ~5 minutes [chicken].

Flip and sear on the second side for 3 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.

Add sliced onion and fennel to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent and fennel is soft.

Stir in the garlic, orange peel, rosemary and bay leaf. Season. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Pour in the wine, then stir to lift the brown fond from the bottom of the pan. Cook until reduced to almost dry.

Lay the chicken thighs skin side up over the onions and fennel, then add the olives.

Cover with lid and cook in the oven for 40 minutes (until the chicken is cooked through).

Serve the chicken over the onions and vegetables, drizzled with the pan sauce and garnished with olives and fennel fronds.
