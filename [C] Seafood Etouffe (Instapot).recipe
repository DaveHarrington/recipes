## Etouffe

Rub shrimp with 1 tsp of Creole seasoning and set aside.

Select Saute and when Instant Pot has heated, melt butter in the inner pot of Instant Pot.

Add all-purpose flour to inner pot and cook butter and flour until the mixture resembles a light caramel color, stirring frequently, and being careful not to burn. This will take about 5 minutes. *

Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Stir until vegetables are slightly soft, about 5 minutes.

Stir in remaining Creole seasoning, white pepper, black pepper, thyme, salt.

Using a spatula, scrape the bottom of the inner pot to make sure there are no burnt bits stuck to the bottom. Deglaze with a tablespoon or two of stock if needed.

Add seafood stock, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and stir.

Add tomatoes and tomato puree (if using) and gently push down with a spatula; don't stir.

Close Instant Pot and pressure cook on High Pressure for 10 minutes.

Do a 10-minute natural release and open the Instant Pot. [Read More: The Different Pressure Release Methods].

Immediately stir in the shrimp and sherry (if using) and close the Instant Pot for 10 minutes. The shrimp will cook in the residual heat.

Open the Instant Pot again and gently stir the shrimp.

Serve Instant Pot Shrimp Étouffée over Instant Pot Jasmine Rice or a rice of your choice.

Sprinkle the shrimp étouffée with green onions and parsley.
