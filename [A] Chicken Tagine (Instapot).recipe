Set Instant Pot to sauté on high, and sauté the chicken thighs in batches until they're crisp and browned. Set them aside.

Sauté shallots, garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon. Use a little chicken stock to deglaze the pan if it looks too dry.

Once the onion is soft, stir in the tomato paste, chicken stock, apricots, some pistachios, brown sugar and tomatoes. Add the seared chicken thighs back.

Put on the lid and lock it, making sure the steam valve is in the 'sealing' position. Set the pot to pressure-cook on high for eight minutes. Natural release 8 minutes then vent.

Lift the chicken out of the tagine mixture, and shred the chicken thighs until you've got bite-sized pieces. then add it back to the pot along with the chickpeas to finish.
