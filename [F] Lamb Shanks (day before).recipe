Brown Lamb Shank in Instant Pot: Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté Hot function.

Dry, season and brown lamb.

Saute Onion and Spices: Set browned lamb shanks aside. Add in sliced onions, then saute until softened (~2 - 3 mins). Add in sliced garlic, 2 tsp (5g) ground cumin, ½ tsp (1.5g) cinnamon powder, ½ tsp (1.5g) turmeric, and ½ tsp (1g) ground coriander seed. Saute for another minute.

Deglaze with chicken stock

Place browned lamb shanks back in Instant Pot and partially submerge them into the liquid as best as possible. Layer the quartered tomatoes on top.

Pressure cook 20 minutes. Natural release.

Taste and Season Lamb Shank: Set aside lamb shanks. Use a fork to test if the lamb shanks are tendered enough. Bring sauce back to a boil with the "Saute" function, then let it thicken a bit. Taste and adjust seasoning accordingly.

> Note from cooking a batch the day ahead for Xmas ‘21. Reducing the sauce well took several hours on the stove. Fridge helped, scraped the fat off easily the next day. Reheating shanks - use liquid (eg cup of stock) rather than sauce. Doesn’t have enough water to steam.
